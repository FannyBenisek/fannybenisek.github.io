  <div class= "center2"><p>School assignment - An original yet functional well thought-out portfolio website, with this idea I started my design process.
The artist I choose to make a website for, Brecht Desmet, is a painter who's main concept in his artwork is virtual reality and the thin line between this concept and reality.
I choose to incorporate his ideas into this portfolio website: when viewing this site, you would have to get feeling you were observing his artwork in real life and not in a virtual space. Layer per layer you could unravel his work through this website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

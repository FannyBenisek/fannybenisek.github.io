  <div class= "center2"><p>Les Ballets C de la B, a dance and theater group founded by Alain Platel, asked our school to design a new logo and website. They asked us to design a logo that would represent the dynamics of their troupe without using clich&eacute; images such as dance shoes and theater masks. The website had to be informative, as well as incorporate a webshop for tickets and include a press-only section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  <div class= "center2"><p>Volunteer work - The International Korean Music Awards is an annual online award show organised by Japako music, an on -and offline magazine about Korean and Japanese music and culture. Readers could vote for their favourite Korean artists. Since it was the first year that Japako Music organised this event, a completely new design concept had to be made. The logo was a collaboration of all the design staff at Japako music, while the video and poster design and execution was done solely by myself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
